Monopoly
====

This project was developed by William Convertino, Aaric Han, Casey Goldstein, Henry Huynh, and Jordan Castleman.

We've created an application that runs board games through file driven design. It is capable of playing Monopoly, The Game of Life, Shoots and Ladders, and custom games through our built in editor.
