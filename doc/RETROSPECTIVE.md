## Project's current progress
We all agree that we are in a good spot; that is, we have been working diligently and
efficiently.  We spent a ton of time planning out our design and how we would tackle this problem which
made the time spent on the implementation process significantly quicker and easier.

## Current level of communication
We have a text group chat that is spoken in at least a few times a day; everyone is constantly available and responsive
in this group message.  Furthermore, we have had 2 formal meetings each week to work on our design and our implementation.

## Satisfaction with team roles
We are all satisfied with our team roles.  We have two people primarily working on the backend, two working primarily on the frontend,
and one working on the intermediary controller and parsing aspects of our design.  Additionally, when it comes to design decisions,
everyone has a fair say and is supported for their idea regardless of whether it is ultimately implemented.

## Teamwork that worked well
* Thing #1
We spent approximately 15-20 hours designing our project before writing even a single line of code.  This enabled us to feel comfortable
with creating issues and executing deliverables quickly without needing to go back and reorient object classes.

* Thing #2
We have encouraged everyone to share their design ideas no matter how confident they are in them from the start.  Doing such has allowed us
to view the problem at hand from a new perspective and also builds team morale.  

## Teamwork that could be improved
* Thing #1
We hope to better communicate with each other on an individual basis regarding what functionality is complete; that is, if someone is
blocked on something or wants to work on a new issue that may be already assigned to someone else, we want to ensure there is communication
between all involved parties before any actions are taken.

* Thing #2
We want to be more realistic about the amount of time that some portions of the project are going to take in terms of implementation.  Right now
we spend a lot of time planning rather than implementing; although this is useful, at some point it becomes a hindrance as we need to produce results.

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint
We aim to try and better estimate how long the implementation process will take for each issue we create; in doing such, we also
plan to divide the issues between team members more fairly.  All of this boils down to having a more thorough plan for what deliverables
we want to have completed by the end of each sprint.
