-likes the UI at start menu
    - simple and easy to work with (when changing player name)
    - likes player color selection
- likes the go back to home button
- not particularly familiar with monopoly 
- make the left panel a bit more explicit as to what attributes belong to what category
- doesnt show on left panel that he bought a property when he did
- make being able to click on property more clear
- switched to updated version (was on a computer with non updated version)
- eric stuck in roll dice loop
  - got him out of the loop somehow (unsure how)
- enjoys rolling in a endless loop
- 

Reviewer 2: Kat Cottrell (kmc113)
- working on not updated computer
- noticed that options button doesnt work
- "ah this is really good"
- chance cards not implemented yet
- all of things she was concerned about when she asked were either being worked on or she figured out on her own

Reviewer 3: Dane Erickson (dte12)
- options button not quite finished being implemented
  - looks good though
- knew to roll dice to begin turn
- looked on left side and likes the tabs for each player
  - recognized nothing to do on left side
  - saw rolls after he rolled dice clearly
- can tell that the players always go to their specific spot on a tile each time
- wasnt sure when buying a property how much it cost etc
  - was told to click on property eventually and info was displayed
  - bought property successfully
- Notification that he bought the property successfully would be nice
- knew to end the turn to move to next player
- has to close and reopen the property tab to update it
- noticed no button to trade yet
- really likes it so far, thinks its cool
  - stopped playing before endless rolling loop error hit 
  - nevermind he hit it

Reviewer 4: Luke Turkovitch (lkt12)
- only four possible players right now, cant make it 5 or 6 etc
- "pretty sure in monopoly that if you don't buy a property it gets auctioned off"
  - possible variation
- likes the tabs on the left side
- clicked buy property on chance (doesnt make sense- shouldnt be possible)
- noticed that left tab didnt update which properties were bought
- likes how you can click on the property and get the property info
- would be useful to be able to click on it directly from the left tab once that works
- end turn doesnt make sense until other functionality is successfully integrated (i.e. trading or buy houses)
- can add color blocks to properties on the UI to make it more monopoly like
  - throw image in the middle of board maybe?

Reviewer 5: Morgan Feist (mjf58) and Kathryn Jenkins
- Modify number of players

Reviewer 6: Evan (ek168)
